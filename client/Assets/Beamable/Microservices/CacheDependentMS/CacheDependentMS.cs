   /// This is example code that explains how to setup a Microservice that caches data during its initialization to be reused in requests over its lifetime.
   ///
   /// Explains the steps necessary to setup a pre-computed data cache that is built on C#MS initialization.
   ///
   /// Potential Use Cases:
   ///  - If your use case requires you to use some configuration/ContentObjects and live user data, you could use this to cache it.
   ///  - If your use case requires talking to a third-party service for some data and using this data to service requests, you can use this to cache it.
   ///  - Etc...
   ///
   /// Things to Note:
   ///  - We use Microsoft's Dependency Injection for setting up the C#MS application internally.
   ///  - The IServiceBuilder and IServiceProvider are wrappers to provide you some utilities when working with Microsoft's DI.
   ///  - Currently, there is an issue that causes Singleton services to be disposed before they should be. The workaround is shown in the sample below.   ///
