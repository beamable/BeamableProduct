# Tutorial

**I. Adding new test scenario:**
1) Open scriptable object **"TestScenariosCreator"** at path *"TestingTool/TestScenariosCreator.asset"*
2) Press **"Create new test"** button to create new test scenario
3) Rename the created test scene at path *"TestingTool/Scenes/001 - NewTestScene_RenameMe"* to any other name (to keep the ordered numbering of the tests, keep first three digits and then add your own test name)
4) Set short description about test (full destription is not supported yet)
5) Optionally add test steps:
   5.1 Press **"Create new step"** in openned test scenario to create new test step
   5.2 Set test step description

**II. Setting up test scenario scene**
1) Open created test scenario scene
2) Add your tests under **[SCENE]** or **[UI]** GameObjects.
3) Save scene
   Note: **Do not** modify or delete **"AutoGenerated [DoNotModify]"** GameObject

**III. Configurating build settings and setting editor for testing**
1) When you have prepared test scenarios for testing, press **"Setup test build settings"** button. You can do it even from _"Window/Beamable Dev/Setup Test Scenarios Into Build"_
2) Open **"MainMenu"** scene at path _"TestingTool/MainMenu.unity"_
3) In this moment you can run tests in editor in playmode or build on mobile. If you want to check or reset test status from the scriptable object then you need to open **"TestScenariosRuntime"** at path *"TestingTool/Runtime/TestScenariosRuntime.asset"*

**IV. Removing selected test scenario:**
1) Select test scenario checkbox
2) Press **"Delete selected"** button to remove selected test scenario

*Note: This option is deleting **only** test scenario - not the scene! If you want to assign scene again, create an empty test scenario and then do drag and drop or use asset finder.*
