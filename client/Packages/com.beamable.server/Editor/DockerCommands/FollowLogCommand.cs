			 * The logs command is meant to retrieve logs from a container that was started during a different compilation pass.
			 * For example, start a microservice, then edit some client code, then go back to unity, then cause some service logs...
			 * You'd expect to see those logs.
			 *
			 * That works!
			 *
			 * But here is an issue, because of hot-reload, if you edit the microservice code itself...
			 * then Unity will do a recompile, and this follow command _won't_ run until Unity has finished compiling.
			 * Unity is slow, and the dotnet watch command is much faster, so the logs that represent the microservice
			 * recompiling will have finished by the time Unity runs this command.
			 *
			 * Which means, if we use a "--since 0m" flag (like we did in 1.2.6 and before), we'll MISS the important
			 * logs saying the service is alive. It is alive, it'll just look sort of STUCK, because there are missing logs :/
			 * Non deterministic missing logs are the worst kind.
			 *
			 *
			 * So to fix that, we can use a "--since Nm" where N is some "reasonable" amount of time that a compile should take.
			 * This will give us duplicate logs, so the logging window needs to be smart enough not to re-render duplicated logs.
			 * We can achieve that by using the timestamp on the log itself. Don't render _old_ logs.
