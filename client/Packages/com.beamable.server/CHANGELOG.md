and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unrelased]

## [1.2.0]
### Added
- Support for GUID based assembly references.

### Fixed
- Client code can handle receiving a `ContentObject` response from a `ClientCallable`.
- Removed Microstorage related null reference errors on Unity startup.
- `IMicroserviceNotificationsApi` can now send strings with spaces in them for messages.
- `IMicroserviceLeaderboardsApi` will now respect `HasValue` flag of `Optional<T>` derived types in all cases.
- Fixed issue with Publish flow that caused an invalid Manifest data to exist when publishing any services along a service whose source code was no longer in the project
- Fixed issue that made it possible to start a remote service without its dependencies up and running (only happened in cases where the service was only remote --- ie: the source code for it was not present in the project)   


## [1.1.4]
### Fixed
- Thrown `MicroserviceExceptions` from `[ClientCallable]` methods will result in an appropriate error response.

## [1.1.3]
no changes

## [1.1.2]
### Fixed
- boolean types are now supported in swagger documentation

## [1.1.1]
### Changed
- Realm switch now triggers `Microservice Manager` to stop all active services. Guarantees the correct service version association with realm.

## [1.1.0]
### Added
- `BeamServicesCodeWatcher` detects any change that makes it necessary to rebuild C#MS images as well as cleaning up Auto-Generated files whenever a C#MS AsmDef is deleted. This makes the easiest way to delete a C#MS's code from your project simply to delete it's folder. 
- Beam hint that warn users entering play-mode that there are stale services that must be rebuilt. Avoids wasting time when making quick changes to microservices and forgetting to regenerate the local image during development.
- `EnableAutoPrune` configuration setting that will remove old unused docker image layers. This should limit the disk space requirements of Beamable Microservices on developer machines.
- `EnableHotModuleReload` configuration setting that will enable dotnet 6 hot module reloading for all Microservices.
- Added `IMicroserviceNotificationApi` to list of services accessible from `ClientCallable` and `AdminOnlyCallable` methods of Microservices. These can be used for server-to-client communication.
- `RiderDebugTools` configuration setting to preload Rider debugging tools onto Microservice development images

### Changed
- When exiting Unity, all related Microservices and Microstorage containers are closed
- Microservice client code is generated in a dockerized dotnet runtime instead of Unity
- Added docstrings to `StatsService.SearchStats` to clarify correct usage of the `Criteria` parameter.
- `AssumeUser` takes an optional boolean parameter to disable the Admin access token check
- Service name must be a valid C# class without culture-specific characters
- Updated Microservice Publish window UI/UX

### Fixed
- Fixed issue that caused the `ReflectionCache` to run an extra unnecessary time when a `.cs` or `.asmdef` file were changed.
- Fixed issue on Re-Import All with `BeamableAssistantWindow` opened that required reopening the window for it to work.
- Fixed issue that caused `StatsService.SearchStats` to fail whenever a match occurred.
- Cannot create invalid service name before validation occurs
- Progress bar in publish window now correctly displays the progress of services publication
- Client code can handle receiving a `null` response from a `ClientCallable`

## [1.0.8]
no changes

## [1.0.7]
This is a broken package. It includes changes from the 1.1.0 release. Please do not use this version.

## [1.0.6]
no changes

## [1.0.5]
no changes

## [1.0.4]
no changes

## [1.0.3]
no changes

## [1.0.2]
### Fixed
- Windows Microservices first time build issue regarding empty build directories

## [1.0.1]
### Fixed
- `StorageDocument` types are assigned ID values during replace operations
- UI glitches in the Microservice Manager window

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- `StorageDocument` base class for storage data classes that automatically handle document ID assignment.
- Automatic Mongo serialization for basic Unity structs like `Vector2`, `Color`, and `Quaternion`
- Automatically generate a client-server shared asmdef, and new Microservices automatically reference it

### Changed
- Upgraded Microservices to dotnet 6.0 instead of 5.0
- Microstorage is out of Preview. Storage Objects can now be published and used in a remote environment.
- Microstroage `GetCollection` method must now take subclass of `StorageDocument`
- Return values from `ClientCallable` methods are serialized using Unity style serialization
- Microservice Publish window has improved performance and User Experience

### Fixed
- Swagger docs handle generic types instead of failing to load
- C#MS Log View stay attached to the bottom of the scroller

## [0.18.2]
### Fixed
- Typless `Promise` in `ClientCallable` methods
- Autogenerated client code errors for generic class and arrays. 

## [0.18.1]
### Added
- Support for returning `Promise` from `ClientCallable` method

### Fixed
- Autogenerated client code null reference exception and list errors. 

## [0.18.0]
### Added
- `ApiContent` classes and execution methods allow you to invoke microservices with data
- `InitializeServicesAttribute` can now be used over static methods to declare initialization hooks in microservices. Supported signatures are async/regular `
  Task(IServiceInitializer)`, async/regular `Promise<Unit>(IServiceInitializer)` and synchronous `void(IServiceInitializer)`.
  `void` methods must be fully synchronous --- it is not possible to guarantee that any promises started within a `void` initialization
  method will have completed by the time the microservice is receiving traffic.
- Exposed `CreateLeaderboard` methods in `IMicroserviceLeaderboardsApi` to enable the dynamic creation of leaderboards in microservices (can take a `LeaderboardRef` as a template or explicit parameters).
- Folding/Unfolding services cards in `Microservice Manager`
- Added clearer unsupported message for microservice's implementation of `IAuthService.GetUser(TokenResponse)`
- Added support for `Dictionary` serialization in `ClientCallable` methods using `SmallerJSON`

### Changed
- Renamed `build and run` to `play` buttons in `Microservice Manager` to be more intuitive
- Can have multiple `ConfigureServicesAttribute` and `InitializeServicesAttribute` explicitly ordered via `ExecutionOrder` property of the attributes.
