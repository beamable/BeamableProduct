- Beam hint that warn users entering play-mode that there are stale services that must be rebuilt. Avoids wasting time when making quick changes to microservices and forgetting to regenerate the local image during development.

## [0.18.0] - 2021-12-16

### Added

- `ApiContent` classes and execution methods allow you to invoke microservices with data
- `InitializeServicesAttribute` can now be used over static methods to declare initialization hooks in microservices.
  Supported signatures are async/regular `Task(IServiceInitializer)`, async/regular `Promise<Unit>(IServiceInitializer)` and synchronous `void(IServiceInitializer)`.
  `void` methods must be fully synchronous --- it is not possible to guarantee that any promises started within a `void` initialization
  method will have completed by the time the microservice is receiving traffic.
- Exposed `CreateLeaderboard` methods in `IMicroserviceLeaderboardsApi` to enable the dynamic creation of leaderboards in microservices (can take a `LeaderboardRef` as a template or explicit parameters).
- Folding/Unfolding services cards in `Microservice Manager`
- Added clearer unsupported message for microservice's implementation of `IAuthService.GetUser(TokenResponse)`
- Added support for `Dictionary` serialization in `ClientCallable` methods using `SmallerJSON`

### Changed

- Renamed `build and run` to `play` buttons in `Microservice Manager` to be more intuitive
- Can have multiple `ConfigureServicesAttribute` and `InitializeServicesAttribute` explicitly ordered via `ExecutionOrder` property of the attributes.
