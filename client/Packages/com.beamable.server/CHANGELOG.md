### Fixed

- Manually adding a `StorageObject` Assembly Definition as a dependency of a `Microservice`'s Assembly Definition now correctly sets up all the necessary Mongo DLLs for the `StorageObject` to be usable inside the Microservice.
You can disable this behaviour by setting `MicroserviceConfiguration.EnsureMongoAssemblyDependencies = false`. The recommended way to do set service dependencies is still to use the Dependency button of the Microservice Manager Window.

### Changed

- Building microservices will always pull the latest version of dependent alpine linux Docker base images.
- `ClientCallableAttribute` is now only accessible to authenticated users. For a fully public endpoint, use `CallableAttribute` instead.
- Microservices will be built specifically for linux/amd64 architecture. For developers with ARM based CPU architectures, enable to the `DockerBuildkit` setting in the Microservice Configuration to publish microservices.
- Building a microservice will always stop the microservice and its source generator if they are running. After the build, the source generator will be reset.

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- `BeamServicesCodeWatcher` detects any change that makes it necessary to rebuild C#MS images as well as cleaning up Auto-Generated files whenever a C#MS AsmDef is deleted. This makes the easiest way to delete a C#MS's code from your project simply to delete it's folder.
- Beam hint that warn users entering play-mode that there are stale services that must be rebuilt. Avoids wasting time when making quick changes to microservices and forgetting to regenerate the local image during development.
- `EnableAutoPrune` configuration setting that will remove old unused docker image layers. This should limit the disk space requirements of Beamable Microservices on developer machines.
- `EnableHotModuleReload` configuration setting that will enable dotnet 6 hot module reloading for all Microservices.
- Added `IMicroserviceNotificationApi` to list of services accessible from `ClientCallable` and `AdminOnlyCallable` methods of Microservices. These can be used for server-to-client communication.

  `void` methods must be fully synchronous --- it is not possible to guarantee that any promises started within a `void` initialization
  method will have completed by the time the microservice is receiving traffic.
