# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Microstorage is out of Preview. Storage Objects can now be published and used in a remote environment.

### Added
- Added support for typless `Promise` in `ClientCallable` methods

### Fixed
- Autogenerated client code dictionary errors. 

## [0.18.1]
### Fixed
- Autogenerated client code null reference exception and list errors. 


## [0.18.0]
### Added
- `ApiContent` classes and execution methods allow you to invoke microservices with data
- `InitializeServicesAttribute` can now be used over static methods to declare initialization hooks in microservices. Supported signatures are async/regular `
  Task(IServiceInitializer)`, async/regular `Promise<Unit>(IServiceInitializer)` and synchronous `void(IServiceInitializer)`.
  `void` methods must be fully synchronous --- it is not possible to guarantee that any promises started within a `void` initialization
  method will have completed by the time the microservice is receiving traffic.
- Exposed `CreateLeaderboard` methods in `IMicroserviceLeaderboardsApi` to enable the dynamic creation of leaderboards in microservices (can take a `LeaderboardRef` as a template or explicit parameters).
- Folding/Unfolding services cards in `Microservice Manager`
- Added clearer unsupported message for microservice's implementation of `IAuthService.GetUser(TokenResponse)`
- Added support for `Dictionary` serialization in `ClientCallable` methods using `SmallerJSON`

### Changed
- Renamed `build and run` to `play` buttons in `Microservice Manager` to be more intuitive
- Can have multiple `ConfigureServicesAttribute` and `InitializeServicesAttribute` explicitly ordered via `ExecutionOrder` property of the attributes.
