	/// This means that, for non-C# engine integrations, this type will be auto-generated for you. For C# engine integrations (such as Unity/Godot), this is not needed as you can simply reference a common library
	/// between both.

	/// THIS MUST ALWAYS BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE <see cref="System.SerializableAttribute"/>.
