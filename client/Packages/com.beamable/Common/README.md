# Beamable Common
The Beamable common project is a NET Standard 2.0 project that is compatible with Unity directly, but is also available on Nuget. The common project is used in the CLI, the Microservice, and the Unity SDK. The common project contains most of the base Beamable types such as the dependency injection framework, the promise library, and core Beamable components. 

## Getting Started
This code is not meant to be used directly. Instead, it is part of the Unity SDK, the Microservice framework, and our CLI tooling. However, the common project is published as a standalone package on Nuget, [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Beamable.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Beamable.Common).
