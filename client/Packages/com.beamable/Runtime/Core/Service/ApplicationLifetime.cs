	// The purpose of this class is to detect the lifespan of the entire process.  In production, this resolves to the
	// creation of a top level Game Object that can only be destroyed by the whole process getting killed.  In editor
	// we have the added wrinkle of wanting to reset this state when you un-press the Play button.
	//
	// This is not a great model to replicate - for lifetime stuff you're more likely to be interested in the
	// lifetime hooks presented by ServiceManager, which represents a play session and can be destroyed and recreated
	// within the scope of a single process run.  However a few things want their lifespans to exceed this and wrap
	// the lifespan of the entire process, which is what this class is for.
	//
	// Note this uses lots of statics because it does live longer than the ServiceManager, and requires use of a static
	// constructor for hooking into the playmode events for editor use.
