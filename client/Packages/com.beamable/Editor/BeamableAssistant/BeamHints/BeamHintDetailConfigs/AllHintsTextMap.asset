      callables with Delegate, Task or Promise parameters. \n\nWe don't support it
      since it's impossible to serialize these types over to the microservice as they
      are not really data types (function-pointer-like types).\n\nThe following ClientCallables
      have unsupported parameters:\n\n"
    - 'ClientCallables with "async void" signatures are not Awaitable.


      This means the Microservice will treat the call as a fire-and-forget and will
      return a 200 response to the client calling the method provided it doesn''t
      throw any exception during the first part of its execution.


      The following ClientCallables have "async void" signatures:

    - 'When creating a Microservices, you must both subclass the Microservice class
      as well as add a MicroserviceAttribute with a unique name to it. This allows
      our systems to correctly identify it and parse its internal attributes in a
      more performant way.


      Create microservices through the Microservice Window''s Create button, so you
      don''t forget to add the attribute.


      The following subclassed types have attributes missing:

      If it isn''t, we can''t correctly store and map your converter to the hints
      it is meant to convert.


      void(in BeamHint hint, in BeamHintTextMap textMap, BeamHintVisualsInjectionBag
      injectionBag)


      These converters have incorrect signatures:

    - "All Microservice attributes must have project-wide unique names. We utilize
      this name to create the docker container that your microservice will live in.
      Here are all collisions we detected:\r\n\r\n"
    - 'The BeamHintSystemAttribute can only be used with classes that implement IBeamHintSystem.
      This allows our systems to correctly identify it and parse its internal attributes
      in a more performant way.

      The following attributes were found in types that don''t implement IBeamHintSystem:

      unsupported signature. Only the following signatures are supported:\r\n\r\nstatic
