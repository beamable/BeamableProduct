    - "The ClientCallables below have unsupported parameters. We don't support client
      callables with Delegate, Task or Promise parameters. \n\nWe don't support it
      since it's impossible to serialize these types over to the microservice as they
      are not really data types (function-pointer-like types).\n\nThe following ClientCallables
      have unsupported parameters:\n\n"
    - 'ClientCallables with "async void" signatures are not Awaitable.


      This means the Microservice will treat the call as a fire-and-forget and will
      return a 200 response to the client calling the method provided it doesn''t
      throw any exception during the first part of its execution.


      The following ClientCallables have "async void" signatures:

    - 'When creating a Microservices, you must both subclass the Microservice class
      as well as add a MicroserviceAttribute with a unique name to it. This allows
      our systems to correctly identify it and parse its internal attributes in a
      more performant way.


      Create microservices through the Microservice Window''s Create button, so you
      don''t forget to add the attribute.


      The following subclassed types have attributes missing:

      it is meant to convert.


      void(in BeamHint hint, in BeamHintTextMap textMap, BeamHintVisualsInjectionBag
      injectionBag)


      These converters have incorrect signatures:

      this name to create the docker container that your microservice will live in.
      Here are all collisions we detected:\r\n\r\n"
    - 'The BeamHintSystemAttribute can only be used with classes that implement IBeamHintSystem.
      This allows our systems to correctly identify it and parse its internal attributes
      in a more performant way.

      The following attributes were found in types that don''t implement IBeamHintSystem:
