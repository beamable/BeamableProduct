# CLI QA Wars 

## Summary

I would like to schedule a QA Wars for CLI. For now at least once, 
based on the outcome we can decide if and when we should do it again. 


## Motivation 

Right now I see two big issues with using CLI:
- there is some kind of "tribal knowledge" how to use some of the commands correctly.
- most of the team is not aware of what can be done using CLI tools.

## Implementation
