## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `BeamGenerateSchemaAttribute` that can be used to include custom types declared inside microservices in the service's OpenAPI spec's schema list.
  This includes the type in the list of types generated by client-code generation. 
  This can be used to avoid having to sync schemas between Unreal (or any non-C# product) and the services/storages that use them.  

### Fixed
- services running locally will use adaptive port bindings to avoid port collisions
- JoinTournaments api now propagates the tournamentId to the inner GetPlayerStatus call, which reduces the amount of data fetched
