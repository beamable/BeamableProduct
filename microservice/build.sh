# As of July 21, 2022, being able to load multi-arch builds isn't supported. -> https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/59
# which means that the following command won't work. Maybe someday it will, which would be nice...
# docker --context=desktop-linux buildx build --load --pull --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 -t beamservice ./microservice

# instad, we need to build only one variant, that is controlled via a developer string...
/usr/local/bin/docker buildx build --load --platform $docker_platform -t beamservice ./microservice

# and then build the arm variant...
# docker buildx build --load --platform linux/arm64 -t beamservice ./microservice

# clean up lib folder
