# About

The {{title}} command is used for initializing a `.beamable` folder. A `.beamable` folder provides
contextual information to later invocations of the CLI. The folder has Beamable connection strings and
authorization information that can be used later.

This command can also be used to change the CID/PID of an existing `.beamable` folder.

# Arg_path

By default, the {{title}} command creates a `.beamable` folder in the current directory. 
However, the `path` argument configures where the `.beamable` folder is created.
