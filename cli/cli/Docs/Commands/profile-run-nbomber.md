# About

[N-Bomber](https://nbomber.com/) is a tool for load testing. The {{title}} command will run an N-bomber load test against a given Microservice method. After the load test is complete, a /reports folder will be generated with the results of the test. The [check-nbomber](doc:cli-profile-check-nbomber) command can be used to assert that the results meet given quality thresholds.

# Arg_service
This should be a valid, running, Microservice name. This comes from the `[Microservice]` attribute argument.
