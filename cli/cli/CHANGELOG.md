## [1.19.16]
no changes

## [1.19.15]

### Fixed
- Progress bars and logs do not appear side by side.
- Unreal Microservice client generation now correctly generates non-primitives used in C#MS signatures

## [1.19.14]

### Fixed
- Docker path issue when adding storage objects 

## [1.19.13]

no changes

## [1.19.12]

### Added
- Better validation and error messages for add-unreal-project command code-path;
- Unreal Microservice client generation now correctly identifies whether or not the OSS UE Plugin is there and, if so, it'll add the microservices code to that module instead.
- Unreal Microservice client generation now checks whether or not the linked project is using the OnlineSubsystemBeamable plugin and, if so, checks if it is configured correctly. This catches the case where people add the OSS after the Microservice was already added to the project modules;
- CLI will now check if its necessary to run Unreal's Generate VS Project Files command after generating client code and, if so, will run and wait for it as part of the generate-client command (it is needed when new client callables are added/removed);

### Fixed
- Fixed issue that caused paths not to be stored relative to the `.beamable` folder correctly
