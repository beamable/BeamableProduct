### Why
The method `GetTournamentInfo` was misleading by not returning the info of current running tournament cycle, but
returning the first tournament info in the list.

### Configuration
none

### How
The new method `GetRunningTournamentInfo` will return the tournament info of the running cycle, it
can be done as follows:

```
    _beamContext = BeamContext.Default;
	await _beamContext.OnReady;
    var tournamentInfo = await _beamContext.Api.TournamentsService.GetRunningTournamentInfo(_tournamentRef.GetId());
```
