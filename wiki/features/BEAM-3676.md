### Why
Executing a microservice that depends on a microstorage through the IDE was not booting up the storage in docker.

### Configuration
none

### How
 - Create a new project.
 - Then create a storage inside that project (`beam project new-storage <Storage Name>`).
 - Make sure you have docker running.
 - Open the microservice project in the IDE.
 - Run the project through the IDE using the Play button.
 - Observe that in the docker the storage is running.
