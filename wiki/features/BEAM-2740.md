### Why
In Beamable, every user has 2 different Ids:

- **GamerTag**: This one is realm-specific. For your players, this is the per-game ID.
- **AccountId**: This one is CID-specific. A player that exists in multiple realms (or games) that you, our customer, run on Beamable has all of their GamerTags tied to this unique AccountID.

It can be useful, for administration tools and certain features to have access to a user's AccountId inside a C#MS.

### Configuration
N/A

### How
There are 2 ways of leveraging this feature:

**Getting the caller user's AccountID**
```csharp
[ClientCallable]
public async Task<long> GetAccountIdForCallingUser()
{
    var accountId = await Services.Auth.GetAccountId();
    return accountId.Id;
}
```
In this case, it'll get the `AccountID` of the user that made the call to the `ClientCallable`.

**Getting the someone else's AccountID**
```csharp
[ClientCallable]
public async Task<long> GetAccountIdForAnotherUser(long gamerTag)
{
    var assumedUser = AssumeUser(gamerTag, false);
    var accountId = await assumedUser.Services.Auth.GetAccountId();
    return accountId.Id;
}
```
While we don't recommend doing this unless you're very careful so that one user does not affect another's account, you _can_ find an `AccountId` from any given `GamerTag`.
In this case, it'll get the `AccountId` of the assumed user.
