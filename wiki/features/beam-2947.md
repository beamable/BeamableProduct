### Why
Customers want to override the version of newtonsoft being used, or pull it in as a hard dll reference instead.

### Configuration
If you are going to use this feature, you *must* have a file next to your microservice .asmdef file called `NugetPackageFragment.xml`. 
The file _should_ contain something like this...

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
</ItemGroup>
```

But it could add or remove `<PackageReference>` tags. Technically, this is a place where you could insert any other `.csproj` options. 

### How
Similar to Config...

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
The contents of `NugetPackageFragment.xml` get placed into the generated `.csproj` file outside of an `<ItemGroup>` or `<PropertyGroup>` so technically this can be used to inject any behaviour to the `.csproj`. 
If the file is present, then the default nuget package reference to `Newtonsoft.Json` will _not_ be made. It is the responisbility of the developer to include any and all nuget package references.
If the file is not present, then Beamable will automatically include `Newtonsoft.Json` version 12.0.3. 

If the developer overrides the `Newtonsoft.Json` version beyond 12.0.3, we cannot make promises that the code will compile under the new version.
