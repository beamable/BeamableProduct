### Why
Customers want to override the version of newtonsoft being used, or pull it in as a hard dll reference instead.

### Configuration
If you are going to use this feature, you *must* have a file next to your microservice .asmdef file called `CsProjFragment.xml`. 
The file _should_ contain something like this...

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
</ItemGroup>
```

But it could add or remove `<PackageReference>` tags. Technically, this is a place where you could insert any other `.csproj` options. 

### How
Similar to Config...

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
The contents of `CsProjFragment.xml` get placed into the generated `.csproj` file outside of an `<ItemGroup>` or `<PropertyGroup>` so technically this can be used to inject any behaviour to the `.csproj`. 

We do not need to specify that we are pulling in nuget at all. The dll is simply part of the base image code, and is already present. 

If the developer overrides the `Newtonsoft.Json` version beyond 12.0.3, we cannot make promises that the code will compile under the new version.
