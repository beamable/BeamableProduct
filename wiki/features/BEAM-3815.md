### Why
If you change users fast enough and while the SDK is sending a HeartBeat to the server, it's possible to get
an error where it complains that the user being sent by the HeartBeat is not the actual user.

### Configuration
none

### How
Now we are waiting for an user change to happen before sending the heartbeat. The error still might occur in
the case that, for some weird reason not found yet, the heartbeat was send before the user start changing, and
somehow the change happens before the heartbeat finishs.

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
(Insert anything else that is important)
