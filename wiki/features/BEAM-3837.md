### Why
We should have a different namespace based on the PID and CID to save it's content cache data. 
Without this change, If someone have projects with the same name, then it's going to override 
anothers project `content.json`. Implying in having errors when loading cache data.

### Configuration
none

### How
Now we are writing the `content.json` to a namespaced path using the PID as value.

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
(Insert anything else that is important)
