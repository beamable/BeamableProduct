### Why
We should have a different namespace based on the project PID to save it's content cache data. If 
someone have projects with the same name, then it's going to override anothers project `content.json`.
Implying in having errors when loading cache data.

### Configuration
none

### How
Now we are writing the `content.json` to a namespaced path using the PID as value.

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

(Insert anything else that is important)
