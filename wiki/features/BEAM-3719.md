### Why
The APIs responsible for checking whether an external identity or third party identity was in use by another player were not behaving correctly.
In fact, the `IsExternalIdentityAvailable` call was hopelessly broken, and would essentially always return 'true' even if an identity was in use by another player.

It turns out this was due to a combination of:
- Improper url-encoding of user ids with special characters
- Use of an array of provider namespaces instead of a single namespace string value (which is what the backend expects)
- Mangled query string with two '?' in it.

### Configuration
none

### How
The `IsExternalIdentityAvailable` call can be accessed via the PSDK or via the stateless SDK like so:

PSDK
```
var ctx = BeamContext.Default;
await ctx.OnReady;
await ctx.Accounts.OnReady;

var isAvailable = await ctx.Accounts.IsExternalIdentityAvailable<PhoneNumberIdentity, PhoneAuthFederationClient>(phoneNumber);
```

Stateless SDK
```
var ctx = BeamContext.Default;
await ctx.OnReady;
await ctx.Accounts.OnReady;

var isAvailable = await ctx.Api.AuthService.IsExternalIdentityAvailable("PhoneAuthFederation", "+18574882877", "PhoneNumber");
```

Previously, it was also necessary to pass in an optional namespaces string array, but this served no practical purpose, and in fact was actively harmful due to its improper serialization into query args. 

I therefore *removed* the namespaces field entirely from the PSDK implementation, and converted it to a string value in the stateless SDK example.

Although this is a breaking change, it is in fact restoring *correct* behavior which was never working in the first place.
