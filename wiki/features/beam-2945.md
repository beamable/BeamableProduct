### Why
Beamable cannot host ARM based images on Fargate SPOT, because Amazon Web Services does not support it.

### Configuration
none

### How
none

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
This is a regression is feature. Technically, ARM upload on fargate spot never worked. We are not removing the configuration properties, in case developers are referencing it for whatever reason, but it is marked as Obsolete and it is not used anymore.
