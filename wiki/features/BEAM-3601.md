# Markdown linting

### Why

Just to make sure that our changelogs are matching format required by Markdown.

### Configuration

In order to be used locally requires [markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) tool installed.
It can be installed using this command(it does require npm installed):

```bash
npm install markdownlint-cli2 --global
```

### How

The checks will be performed automatically after PR merge,
just like there are already checks for code format.
There is config file `client/.mardownlint.jsonc` that will be detected and used by the tool.

We can also fix markdown locally using this command:

```bash
markdownlint-cli2-fix client/Packages/com.beamable/CHANGELOG.md client/Packages/com.beamable.server/CHANGELOG.md
```
