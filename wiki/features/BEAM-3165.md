### Why
We wanted to improve and make user experience with mongo as easy as possible for our customers so we've wrapped up 
creating mongo indexes. From now one there are two possible ways to do that. One of them is "semi automatic" and uses 
methods created in `MongoDbExtensions` helper class while the second one is more automated and requires usage of
`MongoIndex` attribute.


### MongoDbExtensions approach
For this approach as a best practice we need to implement `Initialize` method inside our microservice accessing target 
mongo collection and use one of helper methods.

**Creating single index**
```csharp
[InitializeServices]
public static async Task Initialize(IServiceInitializer provider)
{
    IStorageObjectConnectionProvider connectionProvider = provider.GetService<IStorageObjectConnectionProvider>();   
    IMongoCollection<Collection> collection = await connectionProvider.GetCollection<Storage, Collection>();
    await collection.CreateSingleIndex(MongoDbExtensions.IndexType.Ascending, "SomeFieldName", "Optional index name");
}
```

**Creating compound index**
```csharp
[InitializeServices]
public static async Task Initialize(IServiceInitializer provider)
{
    IStorageObjectConnectionProvider connectionProvider = provider.GetService<IStorageObjectConnectionProvider>();   
    IMongoCollection<Collection> collection = await connectionProvider.GetCollection<Storage, Collection>();
    
    Dictionary<MongoDbExtensions.IndexType, string> indexes =
        new Dictionary<MongoDbExtensions.IndexType, string>
        {
            {MongoDbExtensions.IndexType.Ascending, "SomeFieldName"},
            {MongoDbExtensions.IndexType.Text, "AnotherFieldName"}
        };
    
    await collection.CreateCompoundIndex(indexes, "Optional index name");
}
```

### Attribute based index creation
For this approach we need to implement `ICollectionElement` interface for `StorageDocument` descendant class telling
our reflection system which `MongoStorageObject` will that `StorageDocument` will be using. The second thing we need to
do is to mark fields we want indexes to be created for with `MongoIndex` attribute. After that during microservice 
startup process 'MongoIndexesReflectionCache' will make a scan and will create all necessary indexes automatically.

```csharp
public class CollectionDocument : StorageDocument, ICollectionElement<MyMongoStorage>
{
    [MongoIndex(MongoDbExtensions.IndexType.Ascending)]
    public int IntValue;
	
    [MongoIndex(MongoDbExtensions.IndexType.Text, "MyCustomIndexName")]
    public string StringValue;
}
```

### Note
Currently attribute based mongo index creation supports only single indexes creation

## Indexes deletion
Dropping indexes currently is possible using mongo data explorer or directly from code using default MongoDbDriver
