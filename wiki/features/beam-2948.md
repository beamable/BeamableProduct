### Why
Users would have to wait for the regular StatsService TTL cache of 15 minutes before getting their new stat values. Now they can use the new `ClearCaches` function to force clear the cache.

### Configuration
none

### How
```csharp
	[ContextMenu("Clear Stats")]
	private async void ClearStats()
	{
		var beamable = BeamContext.Default;
		await beamable.OnReady;
		beamable.Api.Stats.ClearCaches();
	}
```

### Notes
You could combine this with a custom Notification sent from a Microservice
