
### Why
We need a way to hide obsolete prefabs from Toolbox view, but we want to be able to allow users to search for them.

### Configuration

none

### How

1. Open Toolbox
2. Type "status:obsolete" into search bar on top of Toolbox view.
3. See obsolete prefabs

### Prefab

none

### Editor

none

### Notes

This task adds additional filter "status" with two possible values:

- obsolete
- experimental
