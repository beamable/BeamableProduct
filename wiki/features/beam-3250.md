### Why
Working with the standard accounts in beamable causes confusion and people are always trying to do odd things.
We should give our customers a more streamlined and standard approach to work with their accounts. 

### Configuration
Same as the old account for avatar/alias/subtext.
In the `AccountManagementConfiguration`, there are 3 stat objects you can set. 
Other than that, no config needed.

### How
```csharp
// get a list of accounts available on the current device
var accounts = BeamContext.Default.Accounts;
foreach (var account in accounts){
    Debug.Log(account.gamerTag); // iterate through the list; it is a standard observable list.
}
```

```csharp
var account = BeamContext.Default.Accounts.Current;

// add an email address
var sameAccount = await account.AddEmail("example@example.com", "passphrase");
```

```csharp
var account = BeamContext.Default.Accounts.Current;

// add an email address
var op = await account.RecoverAccountWithEmail("example@example.com", "passphrase");

// version 1
if (op.isSuccess) {
    Debug.Log("Switching to " + op.account);
    await op.SwitchToAccount(); // change the BeamContext to the current account
} else {
    // there is an error. Accessing op.account would result in an exception.
    Debug.Log("Error: " + op.error);
}

// so that is equivelent to doing
// version 2
try {
    Debug.Log("Switching to " + op.account);
    await op.SwitchToAccount();
} catch (PlayerRecoveryException ex){
    Debug.Log("Error: " + ex.Error);
}
```


### Prefab
Doesn't integrate with old account flow.

### Editor
none
