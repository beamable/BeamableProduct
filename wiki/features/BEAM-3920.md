### Why
We need to have a Beamable Sample of how to use the Lobby API. With this, is possible to 
create new lobbies, both private and public. You can also enter lobbies and view a list
of created lobbies.

### Configuration

### How
Just open the scene `Sample_LobbyManager` and play it. Also you can test it in a WebGL build using
the menu LightBeam -> BuildALl.

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
(Insert anything else that is important)
