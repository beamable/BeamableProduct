### Why
We should remove the property in the project file that automaticly opens the swagger URL. Instead
it is better to have the link always present in the log lines when running the C#MS.

### Configuration
none

### How
Run your microservice through the IDE or Unity, at the last log after finishing running it, you should
be able to see the swagger URL to access the microservice portal page.
```beam project open-swagger <Microservice name>```

### Prefab
none

### Editor
none

### Notes
(Insert anything else that is important)
