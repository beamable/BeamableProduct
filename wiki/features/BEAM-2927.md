### Why
We need parties to allow players to enter matches with friends.

### Configuration
N/A

### How
Parties can be accessed through `BeamContext.Default.Party`.
Full functionality:
- Create party
	To create a party user should use `Create` method passing `PartyRestriction` value and max size of the party. As optional parameters there are actions referring notifications, respectively: `onPlayerJoined`, `onPlayerLeft`, `onPartyUpdated`, `onPlayerPromoted` and `onPlayerKicked`. Each of those actions is using specific notification type holding needed information. Those types are `PlayerJoinedNotification`, `PlayerLeftNotification`, `PartyInviteNotification`, `PartyUpdatedNotification`, `PlayerPromotedNotification` and `PlayerKickedNotification`. Those callbacks don't have to be provided immediately on party creation. They can be passed on an already created party using `RegisterCallbacks` method.
- Update party
	To change properties of already existing party user can use `Update` method passing new values for `PartyRestriction` and max party size. Only party leader is allowed to update party.
- Join party
	A party can be joined with `Join` method passing a party id. If `PartyRestriction` is set to `InviteOnly` the player would have to receive an invite before joining.
- Leave party
	To leave a party user can simply call `Leave` method.
- Invite player
	`Invite` with player id as a parameter can be used to invite given player to the current party. Only party leader is able to invite players.
- Promote player
	A party leader can promote other player in the party to be a leader through `Promote` method passing a player id.
- Kick player
	A party leader can kick other players out of the party using `Kick` method passing a player id.

To receive invites you need to subscribe to `onPlayerInvited` action.

### Prefab
