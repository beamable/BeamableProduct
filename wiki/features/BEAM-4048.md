### Why
Data from `AssumeUser` was not being disposed correctly, and also not allowing customers to dispose
of it by themselves.

### Configuration

### How
Now `AssumeUser` returns a new instance of an object that can be disposed by the microservice. It also
is now creating new scopes for the user inside a object hierarchy that when the service method finish, it
will be disposed if not already.
