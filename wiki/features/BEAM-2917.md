### Why
In order to delete private player stats (accessible only by server-side code) from Microservices.

### Configuration
N/A

### How
Simply call `DeleteStats` or `DeleteProtectedPlayerStats` inside a Microservice Callable method.

```csharp
[ClientCallable]
public async Task DeleteStat(string statName)
{
    await Services.Stats.DeleteStats("game", "private", "player", Context.UserId, new []{statName});
}
```
In this version, you can specify the exact domain/access parameters you want.

```csharp
[ClientCallable]
public async Task DeletePrivateStat(string statName)
{
    await Services.Stats.DeleteProtectedPlayerStats(Context.UserId, new []{statName});
}
```
In this case, you don't need to specify the "game" and "private" parameters. They are passed in for you.
