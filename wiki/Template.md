Use this file to inspire your own doc files. 
Anytime you commit a feature branch to Beamable, unless there is a good reason, you should include a filled out copy of this file. If you're working
on a JIRA ticket titled `BEAM-3000` then you should name your file `/wiki/features/BEAM-3000.md`. 
Fill out the following fields with as much detail as you'd like. At minimum, you should have a complete sentence for each question. However, if you'd like to write more detail, we'll all be better for it. 

Before minor releases, all of the doc files will be reconciled and converted into public facing docs. The words you write in this document will always
be proof read before being made public.
